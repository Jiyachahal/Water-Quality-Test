# Water-Quality-Test
The Water Quality Test Project predicts water potability using machine learning models. It analyzes features like pH, hardness, and turbidity. Steps include data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation. Logistic Regression and XGBoost achieved up to 86% accuracy, optimizing safe water predictions.
